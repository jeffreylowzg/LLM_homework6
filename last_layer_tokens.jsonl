{"prompt": "That's what I know about the guide careers, the student want knowlegde from when they're in high chool.. If the school's have guide careers or activities of work the students, they will enjoy that.\n\nThe seconds reasons is personal but, I see that almost the all people of my country when they come here and they have the opportunity to study but, when they end from the high school they stay in the same thing working in not good jobs earning 14 dollars per hours and some people say now that the diploma from high school is nothing to their. Some people go to school beacuse it's something ilegal, if they not going, I think they will put more interest to the study if they have the opportunity to study what they want to be when they are more olders. The school's need give the opportunity to prepare the students. I know we have young age but we want to be something our life, we have the goals to work in something, we love.

{"prompt": "Lastly, there is the risk that students may not be adequately prepared for the challenges of such partnerships, so it is important to assess individual capabilities before entering into a student-company partnership.. \nPartnering with companies in the field students are interested in pursuing provides a wealth of benefits. Furthermore, developing relationships with industry professionals can add extra time demands and strain to an already busy academic schedule. Additionally, such partnerships give students the chance to build relationships with influential people, which can lead to job offers, internships, and other professional benefits.\n\nHowever, there are some potential drawbacks to these partnerships. Companies are looking for the best and brightest talent, and some students may feel pressure to meet these expectations. Through such partnerships, students can acquire the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to succeed in their chosen career.

{"prompt": "On the other hand, it can also be incredibly stressful, as the sole responsibility for the outcome of your decisions lies squarely on your shoulders.\n\nSeeking guidance from experts and authorities can also offer its own set of benefits and drawbacks. \nMaking your own life decisions can be both highly rewarding and filled with challenges. It offers a sense of individualism, autonomy, and satisfaction in knowing that your decisions are entirely based on your own personal values and feelings. However, this can also create a sense of passivity or dependence upon others, as the bulk of the decisions are made by those others rather than by yourself.\n\nUltimately, making your own decisions and seeking guidance from experts and authorities can each offer advantages depending on your needs and preferences. Expert advice may provide a level of security and confidence within your decisions, knowing that their experience and knowledge can help guide you properly.

{"prompt": "If the family thinks the child has no time to do homework or study for upcoming test then they should talk to the student about the issue and hear what the student has to say. The child should only miss up to five meetings per month with out any consequences. Should schools control how many extracurricular activities you take? There should be a certain extent in when schools can control how many out of school activities your in. The students family should be the deciding factor in whether you leave or not. If they see to many extracurricular activities then there should be a talk with the student to see which ones he can drop for the time until the grades are up. That is if you start to fail classes, your parents ask the school to take you out of some, or if your attendance towards the meetings look bad. More or less said the families have the most say in the deciding factor unless the students grades are dropping or starts to fail some of their classes. Then that is when the school helps decides what happens towards the student.\n\nFirst of all, I think it should be a certain extent in what you can enroll for but it should always be up to the student and their families since that is a major factor inn deciding what to do. This should encourage the student that if they want to be a part of the activities the they have to be able to maintain their grades.\n\nLastly, if the child's attendance to the meetings are bad and are inconstant they should not be allowed to participate in the extracurricular activities.                                                                                                                                                                 . By making the child leave the club and notifying their parents the reason why then should the child be kicked out. Without furthermore, reasons the child could be suspended from coming to the meetings for a certain amount of time.\n\nIn conclusion, the school should have very little say in the decision of a student being apart of a extracurricular activity. If the family decides on letting the child continue is upon them but if they chose to take their child out of the extracurricular activities the must notify the child's guidance counselor and notify the main person in the activity\n\nHowever, if the students starts to fail classes or most of your grades keeps dropping the the students guidance counselor should talk to the student and see why.

{"prompt": "This quote clearly emphasizes the benefits of taking action instead of remaining idle in order to reach future goals. From setting deadlines to breaking down tasks into smaller objectives, taking action is the key to success. Whether it is through studying in smaller rounds, setting the time limit for different topics and subjects, or in taking short breaks in-between, working actively is the best approach to studying.

{"prompt": "Even a positive home environment can have an impact on a person's first impressions, as a growing child is likely to take on the values and beliefs of their parents as they form their own identity. \nWhen it comes to forming first impressions, humans often rely heavily on environmental and parental influences. For instance, a child with a parent who has a naturally outgoing personality is likely to be influenced to be an extrovert. They may be influenced by their own facial expressions, thoughts, and bodily reactions in response to a new situation or person. Similarly, a child who experiences a chaotic or oppressive home environment may find it difficult to be open and trust strangers. \n\nBeyond environmental influences, people also rely on their own internal emotional responses for forming first impressions. In this way, first impressions are a combination of both the individual's and their environment's impact, and it is possible to both form and change a perception of a person.", "extracted_embeddings": {}}
